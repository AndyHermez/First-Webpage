<!-- Planning -->

Draw Layout of Pages:

<!-- FIRST PAGE: RESPONSIVE PROFILE CARD WITH FLIP EFFECT -->

<!-- Header: -->

A logo with a sign up button, flexed with space between!

A viewport height of about 10vh (10% of the document)!

<!-- Top Navigation Bar: -->

A viewport height of 5vh (5% of the document)

Navigation will have animation of overflow

Nav bar will look like this With a nice styling:

https://codepen.io/kiran-r-raj/pen/qBPrgKe

<!-- Content -->

A viewport height of 65vh (65% of the document)

A nice looking paragraph that says welcome to PageForge's website right in the center

Throw pageforge's flip card

A flip card dead along with 3 other flex boxed containers in column format. I would then center them

this will take up about 35% of the document height wise.

The other three will take up roughly 30% of the document's height

<!-- Footer  -->

A viewport height of 20vh (20% of the document)

<!-- SECOND PAGE: TAKE UP THE SPACE -->

<!-- Header: -->

A logo with a sign up button, flexed with space between!

A viewport height of about 10vh (10% of the document)!

<!-- Top Navigation Bar: -->

A viewport height of 5vh (5% of the document)
